# Core Library Plugin Example

This is an example of a core library plugin. Read more about it at [http://gamajo.com/core-library-plugin](http://gamajo.com/core-library-plugin).

An example standard plugin which depends on this core library plugin is the [Core Library Plugin Consumer Example](https://github.com/GaryJones/Core-Library-Plugin-Consumer-Example).

The `X` name and `x-` prefixes should be changed to a prefix suitable for the site it is used on to indicate it is site-specific and not a third-party plugin.
